## Usage
Ensure you have an installation of `ffmpeg` and `xcursorgen` available.

If you have `zx` globally installed, simply run `./index.mjs`.

If you do not but you do have `npm` or `pnpm` then run `npm run convert` (or `pnpm run convert`).

The script will prompt you to install the cursors once it is done.
